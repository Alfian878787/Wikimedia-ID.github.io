Exactly six months ago, on June 27, 2016 Wikimedia Indonesia launched "Besut Code", an online competition program to introduce 
open source software development for high school students, vocational, and Madrasah aiming students aged 13 to 17 years old.

In this program, high school students were asked to solve a given problem, and the mentor will certify participants to qualify for next round
or fall. Participants who qualify will receive Besut Kode certificate and if deemed potential, mentor will help the participants to pursue to international competition [Google Code-in] (https://wikimedia-id.github.io/sma-en/2017/01/06/BesutKodeSMAnGoogleCodein.html), open on November 2016.

Besut Kode mentor, [John Vandenberg] (https://github.com/jayvdb), flown in from Australia, is in Indonesia to train Indonesian participants to analyze and fix open source software.

## ** Why Besut School Code? **
John has been a volunteer mentor for Google Code-in under Wikimedia Foundation since 2014. John's interest to launch Besut Kode comes in twofold: Indonesian open source software user to not only able to "use" but also to improve the software they often use ,

So Besut Kode High School alumni participants will consist of Indonesian kids who's interest and expertise is to fix open source software. 

Besut Code SMA itself is a learning appropriate for children who are willing to learn new things related to computer programming and networking. For this entire Code Besut activity carried on GitHub, and the participants acknowledged that one of the most difficult to learn is to get used to using GitHub.

## ** When was the high school held Besut Code? **
Besut Code SMA held with a span of 27 June to 30 January 2017. Registration Code Besut opened into three waves, which opened in June 27, 2016 (Period I), July 21 (Wave II) and August 21 (Wave III) Code Besut SMA itself shut down all new registration on September 20, 2016.

The ultimate success of participation seen from the Code Besut tested the participants' ability to resolve international level programming competitions Google Code-in 2016, and the announcement itself will be done by the Google Code-in in mid January 2017.

What happens when participants register Besut Code? Participants who have filled out the registration form via google docs then asked to complete [module 1 to module 5] (http://wikimedia-id.github.io/besutkode/modul.html).
