# GitHub activity repositories

Throughout Besut Kode Universitas, participants must remain active on GitHub
in repositories listed here during the elimination month.

Your GitHub activity must be high quality, positive contributions.

If you are a committer of a repository that qualifies,
you may use that repository to remain active.

The list will change throughout the elimination month.

The list of acceptable repositories is:

-  22 October: The GitHub Pages repositories of other
   [participants](https://besutkode.github.io/peserta-universitas.html)
   using Pull Requests.

-  25 October: The GitHub repositories listed on
   [Awesome Indonesia Repo](https://github.com/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo),
   excluding repositories that are only lists.
   You may submit a request to add an eligible repository to that awesome list.
   See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  If it is not accepted, the repository is not eligible.  Join
   [gitter.im/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo](https://gitter.im/GitIndonesia/awesome-indonesia-repo)
   or [Facebook group GitHubID](https://www.facebook.com/groups/GitHubID/) to
   discuss adding new entries.
